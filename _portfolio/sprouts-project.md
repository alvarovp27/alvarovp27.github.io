Sprouts Project is the second version of the Sprouts Framework. Like its predecesor, the main goal of this new framework is to reduce the development costs of web applications. 

Main features in which I was implied:

* Recommendations on the item visualized by the customer, based on the product categories and the purchases from other customers.
* Personalized recommendations for customers based on collaborative filtering.
* Indicators on the customers behaviour, such as the segmentation based on demographic factors.
* Indicators on the sales and stock, such as monthly sales predictions based on the geographic location and type of item.

The following gallery shows some of these features.
